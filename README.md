- Setup directory framework and planning on keeping this project very organized and clean. 
- Main goal for the day is getting the index finished and the general style of the page setup so I can get clear Aesthetic view of the website layout, will probably defer from the original wireframes for a more user friendly and engaging UI.
- Build the logo for the index. 

# 12/11/24
- Index is complete and so is logo#2 landscape logo. 
- Need to add just info to the index because the frame is setup but the info is lacking...
- working on about page currently.

- Working on MySQL and getting all the php connected for the contact.html... little confused right now. 

# MARIADB - MySQL Steps:
- Start APACHE AND MySQL in XAMPP
- Make sure the proj file is in htdocs
- C:\xampp\mysql\bin\mysql -h localhost -P 3307 -u root -p

# 12/16/24 
- Finish Index info page, look over all code, clean up possibly... 
- Do the @media views
- Add Admin login and user login possibly for website additions such as editing the services prices, names, adding or deleting services and overall avoid adding and deleting through code and rather through the website page.
